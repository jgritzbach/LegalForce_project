LegalForce project serves as a tool related to computations of a legal force of court decisions in the Czech Republic.

In the Czech Republic, when a court issues a resolution, the parties have opportunity to appeal against the resolution (unless the specific type of resolution prevents it). Only when this appeal opportunity is lost (or when the appeal itself is not successfull) the court decision will become legally bounding. 

We say that decision is in the state of legal force. Czech laws provide 15-day long time window for the appeal. 
This period starts from the day of successfull delivery of the court decision to the party. However, should the 15-day period end during weekend or public holiday, the end of the period shifts to the next workday.

This project should help you count the moment of legal force despite complications with weekends and public holidays.
