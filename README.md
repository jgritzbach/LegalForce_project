*** INCOMPLETE *** WORK IN PROGRESS

LegalForce project is a tool related to the computations of a legal force of court decisions in the Czech Republic.

In the Czech Republic, when a court issues a resolution, the parties can appeal against the resolution (unless the specific type of resolution prevents it). Only when this appeal opportunity is lost (or when the appeal itself is not successful) the court decision will become legally binding. 

We say that the decision is in the state of legal force. Czech laws provide a 15-day time window for the appeal. 
This period starts from the day of the successful delivery of the court decision to the party. However, should the 15-day period end during a weekend or public holiday, the end of the period shifts to the next workday.

This project should help you count the moments of legal force despite complications with weekends and public holidays.
